# Sudoku


This is a simple Java implementation of the famous game. It has a graphical user interface built with Java Swing. The project consists of 3 standard different sudoku puzzles (easy, intermediate, difficult) and their solutions. Yes, the puzzles are pre-solved as the program does not include any artificial intelligence technique (yet!).
Among other things the player is able to undo an action, erase a number, verify the so far solved puzzle and solve the puzzle by clicking a button.
